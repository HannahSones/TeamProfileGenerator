## About the project
Building on my node.js and inquirer experience, I have developed a command line application that prompts a user to build an engineering team. The engineering team consists of a single manager, and any number of engineers and interns. Once each team member is added, a team.html document is generated to display a nicely formatted, completed team. Each team member has their name, job role and ID featured. Role-specific properties such as school, github username and office number are added depending on the role selected.
For improved user-experience, I have added a customisable team name and included icons to clearly see the position of each member of the team.

To ensure mobile responsiveness, I used Bootstrap and it's grid system to design and customize the design.

## Further Development
* Refactor the code so the same questions aren't repeated in for each employee. They will be stored in an object instead which is called each time.
* Develop the CSS styling so that the team is displayed in a hierachy based on job role, not matter when that employee was added to the team.
